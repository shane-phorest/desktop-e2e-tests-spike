# desktop-e2e-tests-spike
Sikuli is used with Java and Selenium to automate e2e flows in the desktop application.

Currently this is only tested on Windows so steps are for a Windows machine.

Pre-requisites for running this test:

1. Install 32 bit Java alongside your 64 bit - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html (needed to open Phorest desktop app)
2. Setup Maven - very easy tutorial to follow - https://www.testingdocs.com/setting-up-maven_home-on-windows-10/
3. Install Eclipse - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
4. Phorest desktop installed to default location - https://www.phorest.com/downloads/
5. Clone this project and import to Eclipse
6. Run the test in Eclipse - https://github.com/shane-phorest/desktop-e2e-tests-spike/blob/main/src/test/java/selenium/MicroDepositRitaUkNew.java
